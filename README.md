# Image Captioning Project
This's a project about Image Captioning (aka Automated Image Generator) task. To put it simple, It's mean that you push into the model an image, the model will return a sentence descired it. 
In this project, I'll use [Flickr 8k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k). Weights for VGG16 model is [here](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5), we need them to extract features from images. This's my notebook in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/biminhc/image-captioning-and-inference/notebook), It's easier to test.
